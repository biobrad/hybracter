DOCUMENTATION
-------------

http://portal.nersc.gov/dna/RD/Adv-Seq/ALE-doc/

This code is no longer in active development. Pull requests and bugs will be addressed as needed.

Plotting
--------

The authors recommend using IGV to view the output.

http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/

Just import the assembly, bam and ALE scores. You can convert the .ale file to a set of .wig files with ale2wiggle.py and IGV can read those directly.  Depending on your genome size you may want to convert the .wig files to the BigWig format.
